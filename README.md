## Team Profile Generator Challenge  
# Description  
This program was made for the Module 10: Objected Oriented Programming challenge for my bootcamp. When the app runs, it utilizes the Inquirer package to ask you a series of questions to fill in details about members of your team. With the data the user inputs, the program will dynamically generate a clean webpage to showcase each employee as a card, listing their Role, Employee ID, Email, and additional info depending on their role.
